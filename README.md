# Fantasy Rugby 2023 Pre-Tournament Analysis
The official 2023 Rugby World Cup (RWC) Fantasy Game differes from the official 2023 Six Nations (6N) Fantasy Game in terms of points scoring system, in an attempt to make the game more interesting.

The overall affect of this reconfigured the balance of power between positions and players, for example, in previous Fntasy 6N Games, it was advantageous to pick as many points kickers as possible in one's team. Under the RWC rules, points kickers were not necessarily a good pick unless they brought additional points scoring capacity to the team such as breaking tackles, tries, assists etc.

# Aim and Method
## Aim
The aim was to extract a rough RWC pre-tournament understanding of which 6N players and positions would perform well under the new scoring system. Having played the 6N game for several years, a typical guideline strategy might be to select an initial team consisting of players who had scored highly in previous 6N editions, or players outside the 6N of similar styles, then switch out low scoring players for high scoring players after each game week. At the same time, the imposed squad budget necessitates prioritizing some positions over others, again this relies on playing experience to know where to spend big, and where to compromise.

Due to the altered scoring system, this strategy is a fallacy. Existing knowledge of which players/positions tend to be high scoring is less relevant to the RWC due to the adjusted scoring system. The aim of this analysis was to gather an appreciation of the power players/positions that may not be obvious working on intuition alone.

## Method
Each player's playing statistics from the 2023 6N tournament were readily downloadable from the 6N website, while the revised scoring system was pulled from the RWC website. The approach assumed that player style and performances would remain roughly consistent in the RWC, under this assumption, the expected points per minute of play for each player could be calculated. Furthermore, eyeballing which positions tended to yield higher points per minute provided a good guideline for which positions should be prioritized in terms of budget.
