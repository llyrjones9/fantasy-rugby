# Fantasy Rugby 2023 Pre-Tournament Analysis
Between the 2022 and 2023 Six Nations Tournaments, the official Six Nations Fantasy Rugby Game altered the points scoring system in an attempt to make the game more interesting.

Some of the main changes were:
- Removal of winning bonus points
- Removal of home/away points weighting
- Reduction of place kicking points
- Introduction of points for ruck/lineout steals
- Increase in points for dominant carries/tackles

The overall affect of this reconfigured the balance of power between positions and players, for example, in previous years it was advantageous to pick as many points kickers in one's team. Under the new rules, points kickers were not necessarily a good pick unless they brought additional points scoring capacity to the team such as running metres, tries, assists etc.

# Aim and Method
## Aim
The aim was to extract a rough pre-tournament understanding of which players and positions would perform well under the new scoring system. Having played played the game for several years, a typical guideline strategy might be to select an initial team consisting of players who had scored highly in the previous season, then switch out low scoring players for high scoring players after each game week. Similarly, the imposed squad budget necessitates prioritizing some positions over others, again this relies on playing experience to know where to spend big, and where to compromise.

Due to the altered scoring system, this strategy is a fallacy. The aim of this analysis was to gather an appreciation of the power players/positions that may not be obvious working on intuition alone.

## Method
Each player's playing statistics from the 2022 season were readily downloadable from the Six Nations website, as was the revised scoring system. The approach assumed that player style and performances would remain roughly consistent in the 2023 season, under this assumption, the expected points per minute of play for each player could be calculated. Furthermore, eyeballing which positions tended to yield higher points per minute provided a good guideline for which positions should be prioritized in terms of budget.
